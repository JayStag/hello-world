# hello-world
This repository is Preptember for Hacktoberfest.

I am not sure how much I will use this specific repository for the actual event. However, the more I become familiar with Git Hub, the better.
This is not my first expeirence with Git or GitHub. But it was more akin to fumbing in the dark and clicking my way through than acutally understanding what I was doing. Still don't but this is better.
